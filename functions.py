# Double the value of a number.
# Input: a number to be doubled

'''
Because it is n*n the first test case will pass but the second will not and will return 9 
so we must change it to n*2 to fix all our test cases. 

No the code would not have been correct since one test case would have failed, you can create as many test cases as you want to make sure your code works
