# Double the value of a number.
# Input: a number to be doubled
# Result: a number
def double(n:int) -> int:
    result = n * 2
    return result
'''
Because it is n*n the first test case will pass but the second will not and will return 9 
so we must change it to n*2 to fix all our test cases. 

You can create as many test cases as you want or none at all depending on what you need to solve your problem
